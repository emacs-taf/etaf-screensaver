;;; Commentary:
;; Importing copies a native recording next to a small reel spec file that
;; names its provider.  The recording is validated and described through the
;; provider contract; it is never transcoded, so the original tool can
;; re-render or replace it.  A batch import reports per-file compatibility,
;; dimensions, timing, color depths and the provider license instead of
;; claiming that every file is supported.
