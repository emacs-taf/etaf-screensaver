  "Playback program, repeated until input dismisses the screensaver.
A symbol names a scene.  A scene plist holds :scene and optional :duration,
:frame-rate, :background and :params (an alist).  A `(:pack NAME)' item
plays scenes from `etaf-screensaver-packs' and accepts :order, :count and the
same overrides.  A group holds :order (sequential, shuffle or random), a
nonempty :scenes list of programs and optional :count.  COUNT defaults to the
number of children.  Sequential groups wrap in order; shuffle groups draw
from bags without replacement; random groups allow repeats.  Groups can nest,
so a program can rotate whole style packs, hold one pack for a number of
scenes, loop a single work, or mix packs deliberately."
