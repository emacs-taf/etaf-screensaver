;;; etaf-screensaver-app.el --- Idle presentation and input-owned teardown

;; SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later

;;; Commentary:
;; One presentation owns one animation timer, one transient input map and one
;; window configuration.  Stop is idempotent and clears ownership before any
;; callback can reenter it.  Automatic mode separately owns one idle watcher;
;; it never starts a process and suspends its watcher during presentation.
